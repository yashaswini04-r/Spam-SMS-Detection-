# Spam-SMS-Detection-
Spam SMS detection uses machine learning models to classify incoming messages as spam or legitimate (ham). It processes SMS text with techniques like tokenization, TF-IDF, and word embeddings, then applies classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or LSTM neural networks. 
Description:
This project builds a robust system to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham) using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing SMS text data, feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF), and training classifiers like Naive Bayes or deep learning models. The system aims to help users filter unwanted spam messages.
